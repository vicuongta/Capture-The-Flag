I grew up as the twenty-third child in a broken home. My father left when I was six, my mother struggled with her demons until I turned nine. By fifteen, I knew I was different. Others saw chaos in the world, but I saw patterns everywhere. The fourteen steps leading to my childhood school seemed random to most, but I recognized the sequence they formed.

At thirty-two, I discovered my purpose. While others saw meaningless violence in the news, I recognized order in the madness. The seven victims of the Crystal Lake murders spoke to me through the patterns of their deaths. By twenty, I had begun collecting books on cryptography and puzzles.

My first kill came at thirty-nine, after watching my target for sixteen days. Everything must be exact, every piece must fit. My second victim spent five years teaching without seeing the formula of their own demise. The twelve signs were there, but they failed to notice.

I chose my fourtieth target for their eight years arranging books while failing to arrange their own fate. The nineteen clues I left were ignored. Perhaps you, detective, can see what they could not. The four corners of this puzzle might reveal my design.

I spent thirty minutes arranging this message. Twenty-nine words in the haiku - each carefully selected. The fourty-first truth remains hidden unless you understand the thirty-fifth principle of my work. Finding the twenty-seventh key will unlock more than just this message.

Eleven more shall join my collection before my masterpiece is complete. The three patterns you seek are hidden in plain sight. Look for the twenty-second sign when the next body appears. The seventeen syllables of the haiku aren't arbitrary - nothing I do is by thirty-four chance.

The thirteenth hour approaches. Can you solve my puzzle before the twenty-first victim falls? I'll leave eighteen more breadcrumbs for you to follow. The forty-two paths before you both lead to the twenty-sixth truth. My pattern reaches completion at thirty-seven.

I have watched you for ten days now, detective. The twenty-fifth move is yours to make. Every twenty-fourth word is significant, as is the thirty-first decision you'll soon face. Will you see the thirty-eight sign, or remain blind like the others?

The twenty-eighth piece completes this section of our game. Thirty-six hours remain before I strike again. I am always a step ahead, like in a game of thirty-three chess pieces.
